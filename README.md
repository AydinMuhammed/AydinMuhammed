### 👔 &nbsp;What about me ?

Companies looking for a versatile profile in web and software development,

If you know of any interesting opportunities, I'd be delighted to hear from you.

Having been accepted at the CNAM Strasbourg, I'm looking for an apprenticeship contract for a fourth-year diploma in "IT Infrastructure Designer and Integrator - Information Systems".

During my last work-study experience, I had the opportunity to develop on a variety of technologies, particularly in the web, CMS and frameworks fields. My role allowed me to explore both back-end and front-end development, as well as database design. I'm definitely open to learning new programming languages and technologies, ready to take on new challenges with enthusiasm.

### 🛠 &nbsp;Languages and Tools:
